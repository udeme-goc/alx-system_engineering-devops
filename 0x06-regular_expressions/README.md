## Project Structure

The project consists of several Ruby scripts, each corresponding to a specific exercise. Here's an overview of the scripts:

1. **0-simply_match_school.rb:**
   - Ruby script that uses regular expressions to match the word "School."

2. **1-repetition_token_0.rb:**
   - Ruby script that matches cases where the letter "t" is followed by zero or more occurrences of the letter "n."

3. **3-repetition_token_2.rb:**
   - Ruby script that matches cases where the letter "t" is followed by one or more occurrences of the letter "n."

4. **4-repetition_token_3.rb:**
   - Ruby script that matches cases where the letter "t" is followed by zero or more occurrences of the letter "n" without using square brackets.

5. **5-beginning_and_end.rb:**
   - Ruby script that matches strings starting with 'h' and ending with 'n,' allowing any single character in between.

6. **6-phone_number.rb:**
   - Ruby script that matches 10-digit phone numbers.

7. **7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb:**
   - Ruby script that matches lines containing only capital letters.

8. **100-textme.rb:**
   - Ruby script that extracts sender, receiver, and flags information from a log file.

## How to Run

To run any of the scripts, execute the respective Ruby file. For example:

```bash
./0-simply_match_school.rb "Best School"
```
Ensure that the scripts have the necessary permissions (use chmod +x script_name.rb if needed).
