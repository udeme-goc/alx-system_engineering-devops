## Transferring Screenshots

Using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on Win10 as my CLI, this is how I got the files to my GitHub repository:

1. I cloned the repository to my local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/udeme-goc/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
   ```

2. I created a directory named command_line_for_the_win inside the cloned repository.

3. Using the Windows Snip tool, I captured screenshots for each completed challenge page.

4. I saved each screenshot in the command_line_for_the_win directory.

5. I used the following Git commands to commit and push the screenshots to my GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'Screenshots for command-line-for-the-win'
git push origin main
```
